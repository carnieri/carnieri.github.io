## Exposure to opportunity

2024-12-10

If you want extreme outcomes, put yourself in situations where extreme outcomes are possible. Increase your exposure to opportunity.

If you have a government job, with limited room for income growth, then the probability of your income becoming 10x larger is zero.

If you start a company, you might make less money than at that government job, or even lose money. But depending on what the company does, there is some probability that things will go extremely well and your income will multiply by 10 or 100.

In other words, the income probability distribution is vastly different between career paths.
