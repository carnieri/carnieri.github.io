## Important problems

Last update: 2024-12-06

Please don't say "AI safety". I find that worry ridiculous. The real problem is bad actors using AI for nefarious deeds.

### Concepts

- Impact per dollar. If you want to fix a problem, you'll want to do it in a way that is cheap and has a lot of impact.

### 1. Energy storage

### 2. Basic sanitation and clean water access


### 3. Poverty

Instead of asking "what is poverty?", it's more illuminating to ask "what is wealth?". There are many kinds of wealth. First, whatever a person values, that is wealth to them.
- A place to live in is wealth. The more convenient and comfortable the place, the wealthier you are.
- Access to clean water is wealth.
- Eating nutritious food is wealth.
- Being healthy is wealth. Access to healthcare is wealth.
- Having clothes to wear is wealth. Those clothes being clean is wealth.
- Clean air to breath is wealth.
- Being safe from violence is wealth.
- Education is wealth.
- Free time is wealth.
- Leisure is wealth.
- Being able to choose what you do is wealth. Being able to choose your profession is wealth. Having the option of changing jobs is wealth.
- Having friends and family is wealth.
- Access to beauty is wealth.
- A fulfilling life is wealth.

As we can see, the concept of wealth is very broad and permeates all aspects of life.

Not having any of the items in the list above, or many other items as well, is lack of wealth. The less you have of those things, the poorer you are.

If a person doesn't have one of those things, and wants to have it, then getting it makes her wealthier.

In other words, wealth is created when more people have more of their needs satisfied, all other things being equal. [1]

It's clear that wealth is subjective, because different people value different things. But people share the same basic needs, so satisfying those is sure to make them wealthier.

#### Invert

When does a person get poorer? When one of her wants or needs ceases to be satisfied, or becomes less satisfied. If you lose your house in a fire, you are poorer. If you get sick, you are poorer. If your dish washer breaks and you have to spend more time washing the dishes, you are poorer.

#### Productivity

Whatever the type of wealth we are considering, if we want to increase it, then we must first measure it. Let's assume that for most types of wealth, we can measure their amount in dollars. Then the rate of increase in wealth per unit of time is productivity. Say, dollars per year. productivity = wealth / time. p = w/t. This is the same as GDP.

If we want to increase how much wealth is generated per year, we need to increase productivity.

Many of the types of wealth we are interested in require resources to be produced. Clean water requires building and maintaining water treatment plants, pipes, pumps, water towers. Each of those require many, many different resources. That's why we simplify by measuring everything in dollars.

If we build more water treatment plants and all the rest of the infrastructure required, we get more clean water per year. So that seems like an increase in productivity (more w per t). But we had to spend resources to increase that w. Those resources could have been spent elsewhere; that is their cost (their alternatives uses). So maybe productivity didn't increase, or even decreased. The issue is that we don't know how much an increase in clean water supply per year is worth to us, and how much a decrease in all the alternative use of the resources is worth.

How can we estimate the wealth created by an increase in clean water supply? The answer is: markets. Markets function as a price discovery mechanism through the actions of people (agents) who are buying or selling a commodity.

Let's assume, then, that we can estimate the marginal price of clean water, which will be a function of its demand and supply, and the demand and supply of all the resources required in its production, and the demand and supply of the other wealth whose production competes for the same resources.

The point is that the productivity of clean water supply should be measured as: volume of clean water divided by cost. Liters per dollar. If we can get more liters per dollar, that means productivity has increased. There are many ways to achieve this. For example, a more energy-efficient water pump will reduce the total amount of electricity required to provide one liter of water. Electricity is just one of the myriad resources used in water treatment.

Due to the intricate web of supply and demand relationships between different products and resouces, a reduction in the cost of any resource will impact many products. At the same time, if we invent a way to create more of a product with fewer resources, that will decrease the deman for those resources, and therefore lower their price. That lower price will make reduce the cost of other products that depend on those same resources, and so forth.

In fact, if we somehow manage to achieve cheaper electricty production, the whole economy will be more productive, because everything will be cheaper to make. This is why cheap energy is so important.

Another universal resource is human labor. If we can increase the amount of wealth generated by one hour of labor, that is an increase in productivity. We will be wealthier. Poverty will reduce.


### Notes


[1] No wealth is created if a person improves one aspect of her life at the cost of something that she considers more important. Or at someone else's cost. In fact, that might result in the destruction of wealth.

### Questions

What is the difference between wealth and simply "getting what you want"?

What is the research on effective methods that increase wealth?

Here are some ideas:
1. Premature deaths have a high cost to society. It's in everyone's interest that other people flourish.
2.
