#### Maio

The Sparrow - Mary Doria Russell. A book about first contact with aliens. Has some interesting ideas: music from the aliens is what the humans first hear through radio, and what attracts them to the alien planet; aliens use children when first forming trade alliances with other tribes, so they can learn each other's languages.

Children of God - Mary Doria Russell. Continuation of "The Sparrow". Not as good as the first one.

#### Junho

#### Julho

Seveneves - Neal Stephenson. An unexplained event called by people on Earth "the Agent" shatters the Moon into fragments. An astronomer predicts that, in about two years, those fragments will hit the Earth (the Hard Rain), destroying all life on the surface. In order to save as many people as possible (a few thousands), new parts are added to the International Space Station (which already had an asteroid attached to it), and a plan is wrought to build a distributed fleet of small ships. Many people are sent to orbit, the Hard Rain hits, and after five years of struggle, only eight women survive, docking the ISS on the Cleft, which is a large, iron-rich piece of the late Moon. The seven women who can still bear children become the ancestors of a new era of humanity. Through four thousand years, the remaining large pieces of the Moon are colonized, and new efforts begin to reseed the Earth with life. However, two surviving tribes are found on Earth: some who descended from people who protected themselves deep in mines before the Hard Rain hit, and others who did the same under the sea.

#### Agosto

Leviathan Wakes - James S. A. Corey. Terrible story about zombies in space.

Hominids - Robert J. Sawyer

Humans - Robert J. Sawyer

Hybrids - Robert J. Sawyer

About the "Hominids" series. I'd already noticed this in the author's WWW series, and the same thing happens in the "Hominid" series: the author uses his characters to voice his morals in really obvious ways. I wish he was more subtle. This story could have been so much more.

#### September

Proxima - Stephen Baxter. This was a surprisingly good read. The science is good. One thing that stood out is that the people who arrive in Proxima are not interested in the native life they find there. I find this hard to believe.

The story centers on one of them, Red, who is brash but also good.

The Institute - Stephen King. The book is about kids with psychic abilities who are kidnapped and kept in an institute, where they suffer injections, near-death drowning, and other terrors. The adults there use them to kill people at a distance, in order to avoid global destruction. Luke Ellis is the protagonist, a 12 year-old boy with some psychic abilities and a genius IQ. His genius IQ is somewhat superfluous to the story. 7/10.

Partially read: The Gunslinger - Stephen King. I started reading this but I found the story confusing and ugly. Gave up.

Partially read: How to measure anything - Douglas Hubbard.
- Anything can be measured.
- The skill of making estimations can be calibrated.
- You should measure first that which has the largest uncertainty and the most value in measuring.
- If your uncertainty is large, very simple and quick measures can decrease your uncertainty significantly.

A Philosophy of Software Design - John Ousterhout

Some main ideas:
- Write code so as to minimize cognitive load. E.g. naming consistency, no unnecessary surprises.

10% mais feliz - Dan Harris. Sobre meditacao.  
Ideia interessante: não preciso atingir a iluminação (perfeccionismo), basta meditar para ser 10% mais feliz.

Partially studied: Topics in Algebra - Herstein

Partially read: Mindfulness in plain English - Bhante Henepola Gunaratana

Partially read: Mindfulness - An eight-week plan for finding peace in a frantic world - Mark Williams and Danny Penman
- Interesting idea: raisin meditation

Partially read: The science of enlightenment - Shinzen Young
- Interesting idea: noting when a sensation, feeling, thought etc. suddenly vanishes or diminishes greatly.

Partially read: The mind illuminated - Culadasa (John Yates)

Interesting idea:
  - 6 point preparation before meditation (motivation etc)
  - 4 steps of increasingly focused awareness: awareness of body and external sensations, awareness of body, awareness of breath in body, awareness of breath in nose area
  - two types of awareness: focused awareness and peripheral awareness.
    

#### November

Partially read: The Joy of Living

Partially read: Principles of Product Development Flow - Donald Reinertsen

Interesting ideas:
- Queues are everywhere in companies.
- One way to decrease cycle time is to make things in smaller batches. E.g. each version release can have just a few new features, instead of many.
- If resources have high utilization rates, an increase in the amount of jobs, or if some job takes much longer than expected, will make the queue size increase dramatically.
- The Internet protocols use sophisticated feedback mechanisms to control queues.
  

Red Mars - Kim Stanley Robinson

Good strategy / Bad strategy - Richard Rumelt.

This is the first book I've read about strategy. Actually, I've never read any resouce at all about strategy before.

The kernel of good strategy has the following three elements:
- A diagnosis of a problem or challenge currently faced by the organization.
- A guiding policy, which specifies the approach to dealing with the obstacles called out in the diagnosis.
- Coherent action: feasible coordinated policies, resouce commitments, and actions designed to carry out the guiding policy.

Quotes:

"... the term 'strategy' should mean a cohesive response to an important challenge."

"The most basic idea of strategy is the application of strength against weakness. Or, if you prefer, strength applied to the most promising opportunity."

"Good strategy works by focusing energy and resouces on one, or a very few, pivotal objectives whose accomplishment will lead to a cascade of favorable outcomes. One form of bad strategic objectives occurs when there is a scrambled mess of things to accomplish - a "dog's dinner" of strategic objectives."

Bad strategy has the following hallmarks:
- Fluff - gibberish masquerading as strategic concepts.
- Failure to recognize or define the challenge. When you cannot define the challenge, you cannot evaluate a strategy or improve it.
- Mistaking goals for strategy. Many bad strategies are just statements of desires.
